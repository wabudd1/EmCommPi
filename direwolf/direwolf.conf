# This sample file does not have examples for all of the possibilities.
# Consult the User Guide for more details on configuration options
# and other documents for more details for different uses.
#
# These are the most likely settings you might change:
#
#	(1)   	MYCALL 	-  call sign and SSID for your station.
#
#			Look for lines starting with MYCALL and
#			change NOCALL to your own.
#
#	(2)	PBEACON	-  enable position beaconing.
#
#			Look for lines starting with PBEACON and
#			modify for your call, location, etc.
#
#	(3)	DIGIPEATER  -  configure digipeating rules.
#
#			Look for lines starting with DIGIPEATER.
#			Most people will probably use the given example.
#			Just remove the "#" from the start of the line
#			to enable it.
#
#	(4)	IGSERVER, IGLOGIN  - IGate server and login
#
#			Configure an IGate client to relay messages between
#			radio and internet servers.
#
# The default location is "direwolf.conf" in the current working directory.
# On Linux, the user's home directory will also be searched.
# An alternate configuration file location can be specified with the "-c" command line option.
#
# As you probably guessed by now, # indicates a comment line.
#
# Remove the # at the beginning of a line if you want to use a sample
# configuration that is currently commented out.
#
# Commands are a keyword followed by parameters.
#
# Command key words are case insensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are equivalent.
#
# Command parameters are generally case sensitive.  i.e. upper and lower case are different.

# Many people will simply use the default sound device.
# Some might want to use an alternative device by choosing it here.
#
# Many examples of radio interfaces and PTT options can be found in: 
# https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf-doc/blob/main/Radio-Interface-Guide.pdf
#
# Linux ALSA is complicated.  See User Guide for discussion.
# To use something other than the default, generally use plughw
# and a card number reported by "arecord -l" command.  Example:

# Note:  The 0,0 below can change if your DigiRig is plugged in after the Pi boots,
#        so check arecord -l if things aren't working.  - @wabudd1
# TODO:  Can you reserve this address in ALSA config?
ADEVICE  plughw:0,0

# This is the default sample rate for the sound card.  Probably doesn't need to be touched - @wabudd1
ARATE 48000

CHANNEL 0

# Station identifier for this channel.
# Multiple channels can have the same or different names.
#
# It can be up to 6 letters and digits with an optional ssid.
# The APRS specification requires that it be upper case.
#
# Example (don't use this unless you are me):  MYCALL WB2OSZ-5

MYCALL YOURCALLSIGN

# Pick a suitable modem speed based on your situation.
#	1200 	Most common for VHF/UHF.  This is the default if not specified.
#	2400	QPSK compatible with MFJ-2400, and probably PK232-2400 & KPC-2400.
#	300	Low speed for HF SSB.  Default tones 1600 & 1800.
#	EAS	Emergency Alert System (EAS) Specific Area Message Encoding (SAME).
#	9600	G3RUH style - Can't use Microphone and Speaker connections.
#	AIS	International system for tracking ships on VHF.
#			Also uses 9600 bps so Speaker connection won't work.
#
# In most cases you can just specify the speed.  Examples:

# 1200 has worked well enough for me @wabudd1
MODEM 1200
#MODEM 300
#MODEM 9600

# Push to Talk (PTT) can be confusing because there are so many different cases.
# https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf-doc/blob/main/Radio-Interface-Guide.pdf
# goes into detail about the various options.

# For DigiRig, documentation indicates that the -DTR is not used, but
# has improved my personal experience.  It doesn't seem to cause any
# harm at least.  - @wabudd1
PTT /dev/ttyUSB0 RTS -DTR

# There are other possibilities such as serial port RTS, Raspberry Pi GPIO pins,
# and hamlib for CAT control.   For more details see:
# https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf-doc/blob/main/Radio-Interface-Guide.pdf

# Dire Wolf acts as a virtual TNC and can communicate with

#
#	- the "AGW TCPIP Socket Interface" - default port 8000
#	- KISS protocol over TCP socket - default port 8001
#	- KISS TNC via pseudo terminal   (-p command line option)

# Beaconing is configured with these two commands:
#
#	PBEACON		- for a position report (usually yourself)
#	OBEACON		- for an object report (usually some other entity)
#
# Each has a series of keywords and values for options.
# See User Guide for details.

# Example:  PLEASE change the latitude and longitude.

# Packet repeater functionality untested. - @wabudd1
#DIGIPEAT 0 0 ^WIDE[3-7]-[1-7]$|^TEST$ ^WIDE[12]-[12]$

# See User Guide and "APRS-Digipeaters.pdf" for more explanation of what

# Traditional connected mode packet radio uses a different

# First you need to specify the name of a Tier 2 server.
# The current preferred way is to use one of these regional rotate addresses:

#	noam.aprs2.net 		- for North America
#	soam.aprs2.net		- for South America
#	euro.aprs2.net		- for Europe and Africa
#	asia.aprs2.net 		- for Asia
#	aunz.aprs2.net		- for Oceania

#IGSERVER noam.aprs2.net

# You also need to specify your login name and passcode.
# Contact the author if you can't figure out how to generate the passcode.

#IGLOGIN YOURCALL-99 00000

# That's all you need for a receive only IGate which relays
# messages from the local radio channel to the global servers.

# To relay APRS "messages" from the Internet to radio, you need to add
# one more option with the transmit channel number and a VIA path.

#IGTXVIA 0 WIDE1-1,WIDE2-1
